## Abstract
A multiplexer is a unidirectional device which is used in any application in which data must be switched from mul- tiple sources to a destination. It is a combinational circuit which has a maximum of 2 to the power n data inputs, ‘n’ selection lines and a single output line. One of these data inputs will be connected to the output based on the values  of the selection lines. Multiplexers are used in building dig- ital semiconductors such as CPUs and graphics controller, as programmable logic devices, in computer networks and digital video. This paper presents a 2:1 multiplexer using CMOS logic. The implementation is done in VLSI technol- ogy as it has features like small size, low cost, high operat- ing speed and low power.
